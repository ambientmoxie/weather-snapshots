# Weather Snapshots x Open Weather API

This application is a visual weather dashboard that displays real-time data for major cities across France. Each city is represented by a dynamic block composed of colored stripes whose quantity and appearance vary with live weather inputs such as temperature, wind, and coordinates. The layout uses consistent randomness to ensure visual uniqueness across cities and refreshes, while color palettes shift between warm and cold tones based on temperature.
