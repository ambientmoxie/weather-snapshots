![logo-vite-php](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/096f7c33-46af-4c54-bf2f-8d7a641fb2a4)

A lightweight PHP/Node setup using Vite for modern front-end tooling and a PHP backend with environment flexibility (local, host, and build modes).

---

## 1 – Prerequisites

To use this starter, you’ll need:

- Node.js
- npm
- PHP

---

## 2 – Features

- ⚡ Vite-powered bundling for JS, SCSS, and fonts
- 🐘 Native PHP with custom router and environment setup
- 📦 Simple production build output (`build/`)
- 🔁 Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and full reload support for PHP file changes
- 🧭 Clean URL routing: /about loads pages/about.php (no .php in the URL)
- 🗂️ Custom session handler to ensure consistent session storage on shared hosting

## 4 – Setup

1. **Install dependencies**

       npm install
       composer install

2. **Copy and configure your `.env` file**

       cp .env-example .env

3. **Available commands**

       npm run dev       # Start local development server
       npm run host      # Start dev server on local network (LAN)
       npm run build     # Build for production
       npm run preview   # Preview the production build locally

## 5 – Routing Logic

To create a new page, simply add a `.php` file inside the `pages/` directory.  
Each file corresponds to a clean URL, without needing `.php` in the browser.

Examples:
- `pages/about.php` → accessible at `/about`
- `pages/contact.php` → accessible at `/contact`
- `pages/404.php` → shown automatically if the requested page doesn't exist

This system works with clean URLs thanks to the `index.php` router,  
which dynamically loads the correct page file based on the URL path.

In local development, `router.php` is used to simulate the same behavior when using PHP’s built-in server.

## 6 – Notes

- The `base` path in `vite.config.js` must match the public path where assets will be deployed (`/build/bundle`).
- `router.php` ensures fonts and other static files are properly served during local preview.
- This is a work-in-progress starter setup and is not guaranteed to be bug-free.
- You can use it for both personal and commercial projects. Feel free to adapt it to your needs.
